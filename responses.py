chaos before, during, and afterward. Make an evacuation plan and compile
preparedness kits.
Be informed — Stay up-to-date on weather information and warnings. If you’re
aware of the latest information, you may gain a sense of control over the situation.
Talk it out — Share your fears with family members, friends, a counselor, or others
who can offer emotional support.
Accept what you can’t control — Nobody can control the path of a storm or its
damage. And excessive worrying that one may hit you will not change anything
except your emotional well-being.""",

for hills. This will challenge your muscles and help increase your heart rate.

● Alter your pace. Whether you’re walking, riding a bike, swimming or practicing yoga, you
don’t have to increase your pace for the entire workout. Add in short bursts of increased
effort at a faster pace. Over time, you’ll be able to increase the duration of these bursts.
